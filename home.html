              conditions such <br />
              as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make
              products such <br />
              as clotting factors for people with haemophilia. There is a
              constant need for <br />
              regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a
              limited time before <br />
              use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy
              people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available
              whenever and wherever it is needed. Blood is the most precious
              gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life.

              A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several
              if your blood <br />
              is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma
              — which can be used individually for patients with specific
              conditions <br>
